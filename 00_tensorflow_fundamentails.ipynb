        "[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open-source end-to-end machine learning libary for preproceccing data, modeling data and serving models (getting them into the hands of others).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why use TensorFlow?\n",
        "Rather than building machine learning and deep learning models from scratch, it's more likely you'll use a libary such as TensorFlow. This is because it containts may of the most common machine learning functions you'll want to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What we are going to cover\n",
        "\n",
        "TensorFlow is vast. But the main premise is simple: turn data into numbers (tensors) and build machine learning algorithms to find patterns in them.\n",

        "If you've ever used NumPy, [tensors](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tensor) are kind of like NumPy arrays (we'll see more on this later).\n",
        "\n",
        "For the sake of this notebook and going forward, you can think of a tensor as a multi-dimensional numerical representation (also referred to as `n-dimensional`, where `n` can be any number) of something. Where something can be almost anything you can imagine:\n",
        "\n",
        "* It could be numbers themselves (using tensors to represent the price of houses).\n",
        "* It could be an image (using tensors to represent the pixels of an image).\n",
        "* It could be text (using tensors to represent words).\n",
        "* Or it could be some other form of information (or data) you want to represent with numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main difference between tensors and NumPy arrays (also an n-dimensional array of numbers) is that tensors can be used on [GPUs (graphical processing units)](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2009/12/16/whats-the-difference-between-a-cpu-and-a-gpu/) and [TPUs (tensor processing units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit).\n",
        "\n",
        "The benefit of being able to run on GPUs and TPUs is faster computation, this means, if we wanted to find patterns in the numerical representations of our data, we can generally find them faster using GPUs and TPUs.\n",
